# Claude Code Runtime Capability Audit Plan

> **Status: Superseded / historical (audit-method snapshot).** The capability audit this plan describes is done; its output is now the live capability model. Current truth: `src/shared/agent-runtime-capabilities.ts` + `openspec/specs/agent-runtime-capabilities/spec.md`. Kept for provenance — not a description of current state.

This plan defines how to audit Claude Code support in Locus before opening
implementation OpenSpecs. It is not an implementation spec and does not approve
product-code changes.

## Purpose

Build a repo-grounded map of Claude Code capabilities in Locus:

- what Locus already supports as visible, controlled, tested behavior
- what Claude Code may support natively but Locus only passes through
- what is partially supported
- what is unsupported
- what should be deferred or kept out of scope

The output should guide small follow-up OpenSpec changes instead of creating one
large "support every Claude Code feature" change.

## Capability Status Definitions

Use these exact status labels in the audit:

- `supported`: Locus exposes the behavior, controls it, and has tests or smoke
  evidence.
- `native-pass-through`: Claude Code may support the behavior, but Locus does
  not manage it as a first-class product capability.
- `degraded`: Locus has partial behavior, read-only visibility, prompt-assisted
  behavior, or incomplete control.
- `unsupported`: Locus does not expose or safely control the behavior.
- `out-of-scope`: The behavior is not appropriate for Locus now.

Use these metadata fields:

- `value`: `high`, `medium`, or `low`
- `risk`: `high`, `medium`, or `low`
- `needs_openspec`: `yes` or `no`
- `next`: `audit`, `proposal`, `implement`, or `defer`

## Audit Method

1. Read current Locus implementation:
   - `src/main/lib/trpc/routers/claude.ts`
   - `src/main/lib/claude/`
   - `src/shared/`
   - `src/renderer/features/agents/`
   - `src/renderer/components/dialogs/settings-tabs/`
   - `tests/`
2. Read current OpenSpec context:
   - `openspec/specs/claude-code-credentials/spec.md`
   - `openspec/specs/runtime-plugins/spec.md`
   - `openspec/specs/skill-registry/spec.md`
   - `openspec/specs/usage-panel/spec.md`
   - `openspec/changes/add-claude-dynamic-workflows-adapter/`
   - `openspec/changes/add-headless-agent-jobs/`
   - `openspec/changes/add-agent-runtime-capability-model/`
3. Verify current Claude Code official behavior before claiming native support.
4. Fill the matrix in this document with file references and test evidence.
5. Split follow-up work into small OpenSpec changes.

## Initial Capability Matrix

This table is a starting point. Update it with exact file and test references
before using it to approve implementation.

Status note: this audit predates the later `add-headless-agent-jobs` phases.
Rows marked for headless jobs have been reconciled with the current local job
platform evidence, while advanced Claude Code structured-output/session details
still need capability-specific audits before public parity claims.

| Capability | Locus status | Native support to verify | Current gap | Value | Risk | Needs OpenSpec | Next |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Runtime startup | supported | Desktop chat: Claude Agent SDK; headless: bundled Claude Code CLI print mode | Existing runtime paths are mature; desktop and headless should stay capability-specific instead of being treated as one SDK surface | high | medium | yes | proposal |
| Local credential import/login/refresh | supported | Claude Code OAuth/local credential behavior | Current spec exists; keep under local-first credential boundary | high | high | no | audit |
| Plan mode | supported | Claude permission/read-only behavior | Needs mapping into shared capability manifest | high | medium | yes | proposal |
| Agent mode | supported | Claude tool execution behavior | Needs mapping into shared capability manifest | high | medium | yes | proposal |
| Permission modes | degraded | Full Claude Code permission mode matrix | Locus mostly exposes Plan/Agent plus guard semantics, not the full matrix | medium | high | yes | proposal |
| Hard tool guard | supported | SDK `canUseTool` / permission hook behavior | Needs shared capability manifest and tests when extracted | high | high | yes | proposal |
| Scope expansion | supported | Locus-owned guard approval | Works through Locus guard path; needs capability manifest | high | high | yes | proposal |
| AskUserQuestion | supported | SDK user-input/tool flow | Works in current Claude path; needs shared event naming | high | medium | yes | proposal |
| Session resume | supported | Claude session resume | Current path persists session IDs; audit exact semantics | high | medium | yes | audit |
| Rollback / fork | supported | `resumeSessionAt` / fork session behavior | Supported for Claude path; needs shared manifest and clearer session metadata | high | high | yes | proposal |
| Headless run | supported | Claude headless/print/stream output | Basic `claude -p` backed `locus run` exists through the job platform; successful runs still depend on local Claude Code auth | high | high | yes | audit |
| Stream JSON / structured output | degraded | Claude structured CLI output | Locus provides structured job events and CLI output rules; full Claude-native structured-output parity remains a separate capability audit | high | medium | yes | audit |
| MCP config/auth/tools | degraded | Claude MCP config and OAuth behavior | Locus has MCP surfaces, but full runtime-scoped capability/status map needs audit | high | high | yes | audit |
| Skills | degraded | Claude skills directories/import behavior | Install/list exists through registry surfaces; runtime application needs audit | medium | medium | yes | audit |
| Slash/runtime commands | degraded | Claude slash/runtime command behavior | Locus has command guide/discovery, not full command execution capability model | medium | medium | yes | proposal |
| Hooks | unsupported | Claude hooks | No first-class Locus hooks management, status, audit, or safety UI | high | high | yes | proposal |
| Plugins lifecycle | degraded | Claude plugin install/enable/disable/MCP behavior | Locus has discovery/source browsing and some scoped actions, not full lifecycle | medium | high | yes | proposal |
| Subagents/custom agents | degraded | Claude subagents / agents behavior | Locus App Agents exist, but runtime-native mapping is not complete | high | high | yes | proposal |
| Dynamic workflows | unsupported | Claude dynamic workflows | OpenSpec exists; implementation is pending | high | high | yes | implement |
| Usage/context metadata | degraded | Claude usage/context metadata | Locus has local usage surfaces; exact provider quota/context support needs audit | medium | medium | yes | audit |
| Attachments | supported | Claude image/long-text input handling | Current send paths support image and long-text refs; keep local-ref boundary | high | medium | yes | audit |
| Git/PR workflow | supported | Locus-owned GitHub workflow | Mostly Locus-owned, not Claude-native; keep runtime-neutral where possible | medium | medium | no | audit |
| Session metadata rename/tag/search | unsupported | Claude session metadata behavior | Locus primarily uses sub-chat metadata; no full Claude session catalog UI | medium | medium | yes | defer |
| Local-only boundary | supported | Locus-owned local-only guard | Must remain enforced regardless of Claude runtime feature | high | high | no | audit |

## Recommended Implementation Order

Do not implement the whole matrix at once. Use this order unless later evidence
changes the priority.

Status note: the current Locus Workbench focus supersedes this older order for
near-term implementation. After `add-headless-agent-jobs`, the active cut is
Codex Workbench, provider profile run binding, runtime capability display, and
structured run trace. Claude-specific workflow work should remain parked unless
it is deliberately reprioritized.

1. `add-agent-runtime-capability-model`
   - Establish the shared vocabulary: runtime-neutral, runtime-specific,
     supported, degraded, unsupported.
2. `add-headless-agent-jobs`
   - Implemented for the job-backed local execution layer. Future work should
     extend this layer instead of creating a second headless runner.
3. `add-claude-dynamic-workflows-adapter`
   - Parked proposal. Do not implement before the current Codex Workbench focus
     is complete or deliberately reprioritized.
4. `add-claude-hooks-management`
   - Make hooks visible, auditable, and controllable before treating them as a
     first-class runtime capability.
5. `add-claude-subagent-runtime-support`
   - Map Locus App Agents/custom agents to Claude runtime-native agent behavior
     where safe.
6. `expand-runtime-plugin-lifecycle`
   - Complete plugin install/update/enable/disable and plugin-provided MCP
     approval flows.
7. `expand-runtime-command-capabilities`
   - Separate prompt-template commands, Locus commands, and runtime-owned
     Claude commands.

## Follow-Up OpenSpec Candidates

Use these only after the audit confirms the exact current gap.

```text
add-claude-hooks-management
add-claude-subagent-runtime-support
expand-runtime-plugin-lifecycle
expand-runtime-command-capabilities
expand-claude-session-metadata-management
```

Existing proposals to continue:

```text
add-agent-runtime-capability-model
add-headless-agent-jobs
add-claude-dynamic-workflows-adapter
```

## What Not To Do

- Do not create one large "complete Claude Code parity" proposal.
- Do not treat native Claude behavior as Locus-supported unless Locus exposes,
  controls, and tests it.
- Do not expose provider secrets or OAuth tokens to the renderer while adding
  capability status.
- Do not let runtime-specific Claude features appear as Codex features.
- Do not make headless jobs depend on dynamic workflows, hooks, plugins, or
  subagents being complete.

## Completion Criteria For This Audit

The audit is complete when:

- every matrix row has repo file references
- every `native support to verify` item has a current source or is marked
  unverified
- each `supported` claim has tests or smoke evidence
- each `degraded` or `unsupported` claim has a user-facing reason
- follow-up OpenSpec candidates are ranked and scoped
