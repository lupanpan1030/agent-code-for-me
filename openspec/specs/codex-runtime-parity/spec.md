# codex-runtime-parity Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change upgrade-codex-runtime-parity. Update Purpose after archive.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Codex Runtime Parity Dependency
The system SHALL upgrade Codex parity on top of the shared `AgentRuntime` contract without blocking the headless jobs platform from shipping with honest capability states.

#### Scenario: Headless jobs depend on capability truth
- **WHEN** `add-headless-agent-jobs` registers Codex through the shared runtime registry
- **THEN** Codex may report `supported`, `degraded`, or `unsupported` for each capability
- **AND** desktop and CLI callers gate behavior from those states
- **AND** this parity change owns the work to turn parity-owned Codex capabilities into `supported` behavior

#### Scenario: Parity claim is attempted without implementation
- **WHEN** a Codex capability is marked `supported`
- **THEN** tests exercise the adapter or shared product layer that provides the behavior
- **AND** prompt-only instructions, UI labels, indexed documentation, or post-run audit alone do not satisfy the capability

### Requirement: Shared Codex Runtime Path
The system SHALL bring the existing desktop Codex chat path under the same capability and enforcement truth used by the shared Codex runtime adapter.

#### Scenario: Desktop Codex chat starts
- **WHEN** a user sends a Codex message from the interactive desktop chat
- **THEN** the request uses the shared `AgentRuntime` Codex adapter or a shared enforcement/status layer delegated by that adapter
- **AND** guarded runs, plan mode, scope expansion, AskUserQuestion, attachments, MCP auth, usage, and provider-profile behavior are decided from the same capability states as headless and CLI callers
- **AND** normalized runtime events or capability errors are emitted consistently enough for desktop and headless callers to test the same behavior

#### Scenario: Legacy Codex route bypass remains
- **WHEN** any desktop-only Codex router or ACP transport path can still execute a parity-owned capability through prompt-only instructions, read-only metadata, or post-run audit
- **THEN** that capability remains `degraded` or `unsupported`
- **AND** this change cannot mark it `supported` until the bypass is removed or delegated to shared enforcement

### Requirement: Core Safety Parity
The system SHALL provide Codex behavior equivalent to Claude Code for core safety capabilities before claiming Codex first-class runtime safety.

#### Scenario: Hard tool guard blocks before execution
- **WHEN** a Codex run has an approved guarded scope contract
- **AND** the runtime attempts a write, edit, shell, or file operation outside the approved scope
- **THEN** the Codex adapter denies or rewrites the tool call before the tool executes
- **AND** emits a normalized guard event with runtime ID, tool name, decision, and reason

#### Scenario: Plan mode blocks unsafe tools
- **WHEN** a Codex run is in plan mode
- **AND** the runtime attempts a blocked write, edit, notebook edit, or shell operation
- **THEN** the adapter denies the tool call before execution
- **AND** emits a normalized permission or guard event explaining the denial

#### Scenario: Scope expansion pauses before boundary crossing
- **WHEN** a Codex run attempts to read, write, execute, or inspect resources outside the approved project, workspace, or user-approved scope
- **THEN** the adapter pauses before crossing that boundary
- **AND** emits a normalized scope-expansion request with runtime ID, requested scope, reason, and affected operation
- **AND** does not continue the operation until the user or policy grants approval

#### Scenario: AskUserQuestion round trip completes
- **WHEN** Codex emits an AskUserQuestion request
- **THEN** the runner emits the same normalized pending-question event shape used by other runtimes
- **AND** the desktop UI can answer, deny, or let it time out without provider-specific question handling
- **AND** the adapter resumes or denies the run with normalized result events

#### Scenario: Rollback and fork use durable session references
- **WHEN** the user resumes, rolls back, or forks a Codex sub-chat from a prior assistant message
- **THEN** the next run uses durable session references through the shared runtime contract
- **AND** rollback excludes messages after the selected point
- **AND** forked sessions do not mutate the original session history

#### Scenario: Rollback and fork are not safely available
- **WHEN** Codex only exposes existing-session resume without a durable resume-at or fork primitive
- **THEN** Locus SHALL keep Codex rollback/fork capability `unsupported`
- **AND** SHALL NOT present Codex rollback/fork as runtime-neutral behavior
- **AND** SHALL require a later implementation or approved rescope before changing that capability to `supported`

#### Scenario: MCP auth blocks before provider work
- **WHEN** a Codex run would use an MCP server with known missing or expired authentication
- **THEN** the runner reports a normalized needs-auth state before starting provider work
- **AND** the agent run does not begin with that unauthenticated MCP server silently enabled

### Requirement: Codex Runtime Availability Status
The system SHALL expose normalized, non-secret Codex runtime availability status without collapsing setup, auth, provider, MCP, and policy failures into a generic runtime failure.

#### Scenario: Bundled runtime component is unavailable
- **WHEN** the bundled Codex CLI is missing or non-executable, or the Codex app-server fails to start
- **THEN** the Codex runtime status identifies the failing component, local path when safe, sanitized error, and remediation hint
- **AND** the system blocks provider work until the failing runtime component is fixed

#### Scenario: Login or provider profile is unavailable
- **WHEN** Codex login is missing or expired
- **OR** the selected Codex provider profile is unavailable, invalid, or no longer allowed for Codex
- **THEN** the status distinguishes login-required from provider-profile-unavailable
- **AND** the renderer receives only non-secret identifiers, labels, availability, and remediation metadata

#### Scenario: MCP or policy blocker is detected
- **WHEN** a Codex run is blocked by MCP needs-auth, invalid MCP configuration, or a local-only policy guard
- **THEN** the runner emits a normalized status or error before provider work starts
- **AND** the status identifies the blocked component or policy without exposing credentials or raw request headers

### Requirement: Runtime Feature Parity
The system SHALL provide Codex behavior equivalent to Claude-facing runtime-neutral feature surfaces or explicitly rescope those surfaces before claiming parity.

#### Scenario: MCP configuration scope is equivalent
- **WHEN** a user adds, removes, or lists MCP servers for a selected project, workspace, or global scope
- **THEN** Codex uses the requested scope without silently falling back to a different scope
- **AND** reports auth state and configuration source using normalized fields

#### Scenario: Codex MCP project-scoped writes are unavailable
- **WHEN** Codex can list/status MCP configuration but cannot safely add or remove project-scoped MCP servers through its runtime configuration layer
- **THEN** MCP configuration capability SHALL remain `degraded`
- **AND** project-scoped Codex add/remove operations SHALL fail explicitly instead of silently writing global configuration
- **AND** needs-auth MCP servers SHALL still block affected runs before provider work starts

#### Scenario: Provider profile and available usage metadata are equivalent
- **WHEN** a user selects a provider profile for Codex
- **THEN** the runtime adapter receives only the non-secret profile reference needed to start the run
- **AND** the renderer receives consistent non-secret runtime, model, profile availability, context, token, and usage metadata when available
- **AND** unavailable quota or usage fields are omitted rather than reported as zero

#### Scenario: Attachments are validated before provider work
- **WHEN** a user submits an image, long-text, or file-content context attachment to Codex
- **THEN** the runtime adapter validates whether that attachment type is supported before starting provider work
- **AND** supported attachments are passed through normalized attachment metadata
- **AND** unsupported generic file attachments fail or remain out of scope rather than being silently treated as supported Codex file parity

#### Scenario: Runtime plugins are executable when shown as executable
- **WHEN** a plugin is displayed as available and executable for Codex
- **THEN** the plugin entry includes capability state, install source, enablement state, and executable surfaces
- **AND** enable, disable, configure, or execute controls are visible only when Codex can actually perform the operation

#### Scenario: Runtime commands execute when shown as executable
- **WHEN** a command appears in chat, jobs, or command-guide UI as an executable Codex runtime command
- **THEN** Codex has a runtime command invocation path for that command category
- **AND** execution emits normalized command-started, command-output, command-finished, and error events

#### Scenario: Runtime workflows are implemented or rescoped
- **WHEN** a dynamic workflow surface is presented as runtime-neutral
- **THEN** Codex can execute the workflow through a runtime-native integration or shared Locus-owned workflow layer
- **AND** Claude-only workflow adapters are not counted as Codex workflow parity unless workflows are explicitly rescoped out of runtime-neutral parity

#### Scenario: Unsupported feature surfaces stay honest
- **WHEN** runtime plugins, runtime commands, runtime workflows, or App Agent runtime execution do not have Codex execution paths
- **THEN** those Codex capabilities SHALL remain `unsupported` or `degraded`
- **AND** read-only discovery, prompt-only injection, or Claude-only adapters SHALL NOT count as supported Codex feature parity

#### Scenario: App Agents and skills are equivalent
- **WHEN** a user selects an App Agent or skill for a Codex run
- **THEN** the selected instructions, metadata, and constraints are applied through the shared run request
- **AND** runtime-specific limitations remain visible in the capability state
- **AND** runtime-specific prompt injection alone is not the only tested behavior for parity

### Requirement: Codex Parity Completion Gate
The system SHALL fail this change's completion gate unless Codex parity-owned capabilities are implemented, tested, or explicitly rescoped.

#### Scenario: Completion validation runs
- **WHEN** completion validation runs for this change
- **THEN** Codex reports `supported` for implemented core safety parity capabilities and honest `unsupported` or `degraded` states for explicitly rescoped capabilities
- **AND** tests prove declared `supported` capabilities execute through Codex adapter or shared product enforcement paths
- **AND** tests or desktop smoke prove the interactive desktop Codex chat path cannot bypass parity-owned enforcement and status behavior
- **AND** feature parity capabilities are either `supported` with tests or explicitly removed from runtime-neutral parity scope by an approved OpenSpec rescope

#### Scenario: Degraded capability remains
- **WHEN** a parity-owned Codex capability remains `degraded` or `unsupported`
- **THEN** the change cannot be considered complete unless a separate approved rescope removes that capability from the parity requirement
- **AND** desktop and CLI surfaces continue to show the degraded or unsupported state honestly

### Requirement: Codex App-Server Desktop Adapter Decision Gate
The system SHALL keep `codex app-server` as the sole Codex desktop/chat adapter now that the ACP temporary-compat rollback is removed, and SHALL require a documented decision matrix before adding or replacing that adapter.

#### Scenario: Adapter replacement work starts
- **WHEN** implementation begins to add or replace the Codex desktop/chat adapter
- **THEN** the change records a matrix comparing the incumbent app-server adapter, `@openai/codex-sdk`, and any candidate transport
- **AND** the matrix covers provider-profile binding, MCP, approvals, AskUserQuestion, attachments, streaming, usage/context metadata, session resume/fork/rollback, cancellation, diagnostics, and local-only behavior
- **AND** `codex app-server` remains the desktop/chat default unless the matrix explicitly records a blocking gap and approved rescope
- **AND** a candidate is not selected as the desktop/chat default solely because it has an official package name

#### Scenario: ACP rollback is removed
- **WHEN** Codex desktop/chat starts after the ACP temporary-compat removal
- **THEN** there is no `codex-acp-temporary-compat` adapter source, no ACP selection env gate, and no bundled ACP runtime/binary dependency
- **AND** adapter selection always resolves `codex-app-server` with no rollback fallback
- **AND** removal does not upgrade any app-server capability state to `supported`, and existing degraded or unsupported states remain represented honestly

### Requirement: Codex App-Server Behavior Preservation
The system SHALL preserve existing Codex desktop/chat safety and runtime behavior when migrating to app-server, or explicitly rescope unavailable behavior before enabling app-server by default.

#### Scenario: App-server is enabled for desktop chat
- **WHEN** the Codex app-server adapter handles a desktop chat run
- **THEN** provider-profile binding, MCP readiness, plan-mode enforcement, guarded-run permission handling, AskUserQuestion, supported attachments, streaming output, usage/session metadata, and cancellation are preserved where previously supported
- **AND** unsupported or degraded behavior is represented through the Codex capability manifest before provider work starts
- **AND** tests cover each capability changed to or kept as `supported`

#### Scenario: App-server lacks a required safety primitive
- **WHEN** the Codex app-server adapter cannot install approval, permission, plan-mode, or guarded-run enforcement before execution
- **THEN** guarded or plan-mode Codex runs fail closed or fall back to a supported adapter according to explicit policy
- **AND** the system emits a renderer-safe unsupported-capability or fallback diagnostic
- **AND** the capability is not marked `supported` for that adapter

### Requirement: Codex App-Server Pre-Execution Safety
The system SHALL prove that the Codex app-server adapter can enforce Locus safety decisions before tool, shell, file, or MCP side effects occur.

#### Scenario: Permission interception is unavailable
- **WHEN** a Codex run requires plan-mode or guarded-run enforcement
- **AND** the app-server adapter does not expose a verified pre-execution permission or approval callback
- **THEN** the run fails closed before provider work starts or uses an explicitly supported fallback adapter
- **AND** the runtime capability state remains `degraded` or `unsupported` for that adapter

#### Scenario: Permission interception is installed late
- **WHEN** adapter startup cannot prove the permission or approval callback is installed before the first model/tool turn
- **THEN** the run fails before the first tool request can execute
- **AND** the diagnostic explains the adapter safety setup failure without exposing secrets

### Requirement: Codex Programmatic Surface Boundary
The system SHALL treat Codex SDK, Codex app-server, and `codex exec` as distinct Codex programmatic surfaces with separate capability states.

#### Scenario: Desktop and headless surfaces are displayed
- **WHEN** Locus shows or records Codex runtime metadata
- **THEN** it distinguishes desktop/chat adapter source from headless `codex exec` source
- **AND** it does not infer headless support from desktop adapter support or desktop support from headless `codex exec`
- **AND** each surface reports its own supported, degraded, and unsupported capability states

#### Scenario: Headless Codex remains on exec
- **WHEN** desktop/chat runs on app-server while headless Codex still uses `codex exec`
- **THEN** the headless path remains labeled as batch/fallback mode
- **AND** missing rich event, approval, or session primitives remain degraded or unsupported for headless until separately implemented and tested

### Requirement: Codex Native Boundary Forwarding And Disposition
The Codex transport SHALL forward responses, notifications, server requests,
response-send/resolved and exits to the ledger ports once with original request
correlation. decodeCodexNativeBoundary SHALL implement the complete 66/10/16
method/item disposition table below without owning sequence, outcome or mutable usage state.
Observed-deferred surfaces SHALL not be mislabeled unknown or upgraded to supported.

| Notification methods (66 total) | Canonical disposition |
| --- | --- |
| account/login/completed, mcpServer/oauthLogin/completed | status/oauth_lifecycle |
| account/rateLimits/updated, account/updated | status/account_lifecycle |
| app/list/updated, externalAgentConfig/import/completed, skills/changed | status/configuration |
| command/exec/outputDelta, process/outputDelta, process/exited | status/runtime_process (process/exited notification is not transport exit) |

| hook/completed, hook/started | status/hook_lifecycle |
| item/agentMessage/delta | assistant_delta |
| item/autoApprovalReview/completed, item/autoApprovalReview/started | status/approval_review |
| item/commandExecution/outputDelta, item/commandExecution/terminalInteraction, item/fileChange/outputDelta, item/fileChange/patchUpdated, item/mcpToolCall/progress | tool_delta (terminalInteraction is tool evidence, not a second Interaction FSM) |
| item/completed, item/started | item table below, including reconciliation on completed |
| item/plan/delta, turn/plan/updated | status/plan |
| item/reasoning/summaryPartAdded | status/reasoning_part |
| item/reasoning/summaryTextDelta, item/reasoning/textDelta | reasoning_delta with distinct channel/partIndex |
| mcpServer/startupStatus/updated | status/mcp_lifecycle |
| model/rerouted | status/reroute |
| model/verification, turn/moderationMetadata | status/model_verification |
| rawResponseItem/completed | status/raw_response_observed (allowlisted metadata only, contentOmitted:true) |
| remoteControl/status/changed, windows/worldWritableWarning, windowsSandbox/setupCompleted | status/unsupported_native_surface with surface=remote_control or windows and disposition=observed_deferred |
| serverRequest/resolved | status/interaction_boundary, boundary=resolved |
| thread/archived, thread/closed, thread/goal/cleared, thread/goal/updated, thread/name/updated, thread/settings/updated, thread/started, thread/status/changed, thread/unarchived | status/thread_lifecycle |
| thread/compacted | status/compaction |
| thread/realtime/closed, thread/realtime/error, thread/realtime/itemAdded, thread/realtime/outputAudio/delta, thread/realtime/sdp, thread/realtime/started, thread/realtime/transcript/delta, thread/realtime/transcript/done | status/unsupported_native_surface, surface=realtime, disposition=observed_deferred |
| thread/tokenUsage/updated | usage_update (after seal: late_event with observed usage) |
| turn/completed | terminal candidate, settled by core outcome rule |
| turn/diff/updated | status/diff_observation plus candidate evidence to artifact owner; no direct artifact event |
| turn/started | status/turn_lifecycle |

| Server request methods (10 total) | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| account/chatgptAuthTokens/refresh, applyPatchApproval, attestation/generate, execCommandApproval, item/commandExecution/requestApproval, item/fileChange/requestApproval, item/permissions/requestApproval, item/tool/call, item/tool/requestUserInput, mcpServer/elicitation/request | status/interaction_boundary, boundary=request, native method + requestId; exact existing safety owner still handles authorization; no credential material persists |

For each request, response-send records boundary=response_send and sent/failed;
serverRequest/resolved records boundary=resolved. A response-send failure does not
claim success or resolution. Transport passes the resolved notification only once to
recordServerRequestResolved; it must not also ingest a duplicate generic notification.
Other client responses emit status/protocol_response with request correlation and
sanitized result/error metadata; thread/resume uses native_resume_validated/native_resume_rejected as specified by
agent-runtime-core Native Resume Validation Facts.

| ThreadItem variants (16 total) | started / completed disposition |
| --- | --- |
| agentMessage | status/item_lifecycle then status/item_reconciliation; assistant deltas and authoritative readItem text |
| reasoning | status/item_lifecycle then status/item_reconciliation; separate content/text and summary parts |
| commandExecution, mcpToolCall, dynamicToolCall, collabAgentToolCall, webSearch, imageView, imageGeneration, fileChange | tool_started / tool_finished plus item_reconciliation; imageGeneration.savedPath and fileChange/diff only feed artifact candidates |
| contextCompaction | status/compaction |
| enteredReviewMode, exitedReviewMode | status/review_mode |
| hookPrompt | status/hook_lifecycle |
| plan | status/plan |
| userMessage | status/user_message (including snapshot user items), no assistant output |

#### Scenario: Transport forwards protocol boundary shapes
- **WHEN** the fake transport is driven by `ingress-boundaries.jsonl` with a spy ledger
- **THEN** each inbound/outbound boundary invokes its correct port once in arrival
  order with observationKey and request context; resolved is not sent twice
- **AND** a successful thread/resume response is forwarded as a response, without an
  invented thread/started notification or sessionId fallback

#### Scenario: Pinned native surface has complete disposition
- **WHEN** decodeCodexNativeBoundary receives every schema-derived notification,
  server-request and item case in `native-dispositions.json`
- **THEN** decoded domain event/status subtype exactly matches this requirement's inline table for
  all 66 notification methods, 10 requests and 16 item variants
- **AND** plan/hook/model-verification and six non-tool variants have explicit categories;
  realtime/remote-control/windows are observed_deferred with contentOmitted, not unknown
- **AND** the fixture's capability manifest is unchanged; observation alone grants no support

#### Scenario: Decoder retains channel and native error fields
- **WHEN** `codex-decode.json` supplies reasoning text/summary deltas with schema-proven
  indexes when available and with absent indexes otherwise,
  retry error code/willRetry and usage total/last vectors
- **THEN** decoded observation descriptors retain those exact fields and channel keys
  for the core owner without inventing an absent index; summary boundary state and
  inferred fallback belong to the ledger, and decoder output depends only on its input
- **AND** descriptors contain no assigned sequence or inferred succeeded terminal
