## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Codex Runtime Parity Dependency
The system SHALL upgrade Codex parity on top of the shared `AgentRuntime` contract without blocking the headless jobs platform from shipping with honest capability states.

#### Scenario: Headless jobs depend on capability truth
- **WHEN** `add-headless-agent-jobs` registers Codex through the shared runtime registry
- **THEN** Codex may report `supported`, `degraded`, or `unsupported` for each capability
- **AND** desktop and CLI callers gate behavior from those states
- **AND** this parity change owns the work to turn parity-owned Codex capabilities into `supported` behavior

#### Scenario: Parity claim is attempted without implementation
- **WHEN** a Codex capability is marked `supported`
- **THEN** tests exercise the adapter or shared product layer that provides the behavior
- **AND** prompt-only instructions, UI labels, indexed documentation, or post-run audit alone do not satisfy the capability

### Requirement: Shared Codex Runtime Path
The system SHALL bring the existing desktop Codex chat path under the same capability and enforcement truth used by the shared Codex runtime adapter.

#### Scenario: Desktop Codex chat starts
- **WHEN** a user sends a Codex message from the interactive desktop chat
- **THEN** the request uses the shared `AgentRuntime` Codex adapter or a shared enforcement/status layer delegated by that adapter
- **AND** guarded runs, plan mode, scope expansion, AskUserQuestion, attachments, MCP auth, usage, and provider-profile behavior are decided from the same capability states as headless and CLI callers
- **AND** normalized runtime events or capability errors are emitted consistently enough for desktop and headless callers to test the same behavior

#### Scenario: Legacy Codex route bypass remains
- **WHEN** any desktop-only Codex router or ACP transport path can still execute a parity-owned capability through prompt-only instructions, read-only metadata, or post-run audit
- **THEN** that capability remains `degraded` or `unsupported`
- **AND** this change cannot mark it `supported` until the bypass is removed or delegated to shared enforcement

### Requirement: Core Safety Parity
The system SHALL provide Codex behavior equivalent to Claude Code for core safety capabilities before claiming Codex first-class runtime safety.

#### Scenario: Hard tool guard blocks before execution
- **WHEN** a Codex run has an approved guarded scope contract
- **AND** the runtime attempts a write, edit, shell, or file operation outside the approved scope
- **THEN** the Codex adapter denies or rewrites the tool call before the tool executes
- **AND** emits a normalized guard event with runtime ID, tool name, decision, and reason

#### Scenario: Plan mode blocks unsafe tools
- **WHEN** a Codex run is in plan mode
- **AND** the runtime attempts a blocked write, edit, notebook edit, or shell operation
- **THEN** the adapter denies the tool call before execution
- **AND** emits a normalized permission or guard event explaining the denial

#### Scenario: Scope expansion pauses before boundary crossing
- **WHEN** a Codex run attempts to read, write, execute, or inspect resources outside the approved project, workspace, or user-approved scope
- **THEN** the adapter pauses before crossing that boundary
- **AND** emits a normalized scope-expansion request with runtime ID, requested scope, reason, and affected operation
- **AND** does not continue the operation until the user or policy grants approval

#### Scenario: AskUserQuestion round trip completes
- **WHEN** Codex emits an AskUserQuestion request
- **THEN** the runner emits the same normalized pending-question event shape used by other runtimes
- **AND** the desktop UI can answer, deny, or let it time out without provider-specific question handling
- **AND** the adapter resumes or denies the run with normalized result events

#### Scenario: Rollback and fork use durable session references
- **WHEN** the user resumes, rolls back, or forks a Codex sub-chat from a prior assistant message
- **THEN** the next run uses durable session references through the shared runtime contract
- **AND** rollback excludes messages after the selected point
- **AND** forked sessions do not mutate the original session history

#### Scenario: MCP auth blocks before provider work
- **WHEN** a Codex run would use an MCP server with known missing or expired authentication
- **THEN** the runner reports a normalized needs-auth state before starting provider work
- **AND** the agent run does not begin with that unauthenticated MCP server silently enabled

### Requirement: Codex Runtime Availability Status
The system SHALL expose normalized, non-secret Codex runtime availability status without collapsing setup, auth, provider, MCP, and policy failures into a generic runtime failure.

#### Scenario: Bundled runtime component is unavailable
- **WHEN** the bundled Codex CLI is missing, the bundled ACP runtime is missing or non-executable, or the ACP spawn probe fails
- **THEN** the Codex runtime status identifies the failing component, local path when safe, sanitized error, and remediation hint
- **AND** the system blocks provider work until the failing runtime component is fixed

#### Scenario: Login or provider profile is unavailable
- **WHEN** Codex login is missing or expired
- **OR** the selected Codex provider profile is unavailable, invalid, or no longer allowed for Codex
- **THEN** the status distinguishes login-required from provider-profile-unavailable
- **AND** the renderer receives only non-secret identifiers, labels, availability, and remediation metadata

#### Scenario: MCP or policy blocker is detected
- **WHEN** a Codex run is blocked by MCP needs-auth, invalid MCP configuration, or a local-only policy guard
- **THEN** the runner emits a normalized status or error before provider work starts
- **AND** the status identifies the blocked component or policy without exposing credentials or raw request headers

### Requirement: Runtime Feature Parity
The system SHALL provide Codex behavior equivalent to Claude-facing runtime-neutral feature surfaces or explicitly rescope those surfaces before claiming parity.

#### Scenario: MCP configuration scope is equivalent
- **WHEN** a user adds, removes, or lists MCP servers for a selected project, workspace, or global scope
- **THEN** Codex uses the requested scope without silently falling back to a different scope
- **AND** reports auth state and configuration source using normalized fields

#### Scenario: Provider profile and usage metadata are equivalent
- **WHEN** a user selects a provider profile for Codex
- **THEN** the runtime adapter receives only the non-secret profile reference needed to start the run
- **AND** the renderer receives consistent non-secret runtime, model, profile, availability, context, token, quota, and usage metadata when available

#### Scenario: Attachments are validated before provider work
- **WHEN** a user submits an image, long-text, or file attachment to Codex
- **THEN** the runtime adapter validates whether that attachment type is supported before starting provider work
- **AND** supported attachments are passed through normalized attachment metadata
- **AND** unsupported attachments fail with a normalized capability error rather than provider-specific UI behavior

#### Scenario: Runtime plugins are executable when shown as executable
- **WHEN** a plugin is displayed as available and executable for Codex
- **THEN** the plugin entry includes capability state, install source, enablement state, and executable surfaces
- **AND** enable, disable, configure, or execute controls are visible only when Codex can actually perform the operation

#### Scenario: Runtime commands execute when shown as executable
- **WHEN** a command appears in chat, jobs, or command-guide UI as an executable Codex runtime command
- **THEN** Codex has a runtime command invocation path for that command category
- **AND** execution emits normalized command-started, command-output, command-finished, and error events

#### Scenario: Runtime workflows are implemented or rescoped
- **WHEN** a dynamic workflow surface is presented as runtime-neutral
- **THEN** Codex can execute the workflow through a runtime-native integration or shared Locus-owned workflow layer
- **AND** Claude-only workflow adapters are not counted as Codex workflow parity unless workflows are explicitly rescoped out of runtime-neutral parity

#### Scenario: App Agents and skills are equivalent
- **WHEN** a user selects an App Agent or skill for a Codex run
- **THEN** the selected instructions, metadata, and constraints are applied through the shared run request
- **AND** runtime-specific limitations remain visible in the capability state
- **AND** runtime-specific prompt injection alone is not the only tested behavior for parity

### Requirement: Codex Parity Completion Gate
The system SHALL fail this change's completion gate unless Codex parity-owned capabilities are implemented, tested, or explicitly rescoped.

#### Scenario: Completion validation runs
- **WHEN** completion validation runs for this change
- **THEN** Codex reports `supported` for core safety parity capabilities
- **AND** tests prove those declared capabilities execute through Codex adapter or shared product enforcement paths
- **AND** tests or desktop smoke prove the interactive desktop Codex chat path cannot bypass parity-owned enforcement and status behavior
- **AND** feature parity capabilities are either `supported` with tests or explicitly removed from runtime-neutral parity scope by an approved OpenSpec rescope

#### Scenario: Degraded capability remains
- **WHEN** a parity-owned Codex capability remains `degraded` or `unsupported`
- **THEN** the change cannot be considered complete unless a separate approved rescope removes that capability from the parity requirement
- **AND** desktop and CLI surfaces continue to show the degraded or unsupported state honestly
