# Local Job API v1 Consumer Guide

Languages: English | [Simplified Chinese](local-job-api-v1-consumer-guide.zh-CN.md)

This guide is for downstream local applications that want to use Locus as the
runtime layer without importing Locus source code or reading `agents.db`
directly. The contract is runtime- and domain-neutral.

The v1 entrypoint is the machine-readable CLI group:

```bash
locus api ...
```

Machine-readable contract: [local-job-api-v1.schema.json](local-job-api-v1.schema.json)

Use `locus api` for integrations. Keep `locus run` and `locus jobs` for humans
and compatibility scripts.

## Documentation Model

This guide follows the structure of established official manuals:

- [GitHub CLI Manual](https://cli.github.com/manual/) separates installation,
  configuration, command reference, and examples for scriptable CLI use.
- [Stripe API Reference](https://docs.stripe.com/api?lang=curl) makes request
  and response envelopes explicit and treats errors as part of the integration
  contract.
- [Docker CLI Reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/)
  documents environment/configuration rules, examples, subcommands, and
  sensitive configuration warnings.

The Locus guide applies those patterns to a local CLI + JSON contract rather
than an HTTP API.

## What v1 Provides

Local Job API v1 lets a consumer:

- list runtime capability manifests
- create an agent run
- read run status
- read normalized event envelopes
- read the final result envelope
- cancel a queued or running API job
- retry a failed, canceled, or interrupted API job
- collect run-owned metadata artifacts
- register, inspect, and non-destructively unregister local project workspaces

It does not provide:

- an HTTP or WebSocket server
- hosted queues or cloud agents
- direct writes into downstream `final/` artifacts
- provider credential passing from the consumer
- access to Locus SQLite internals
- a complete OS sandbox
- project history deletion from CLI or Local Job API commands

## Install and Locate the CLI

The packaged app includes a `locus` launcher. During development, this repo uses:

```bash
resources/cli/locus api runtimes list --json
```

For a packaged macOS app, the launcher is under the app resources directory:

```bash
/Applications/Locus.app/Contents/Resources/cli/locus api runtimes list --json
```

For Windows, use the packaged `locus.cmd` launcher from the app resources
directory. Source-level shim behavior is tested, but Windows packaged
real-machine smoke is explicitly deferred and is not required for current
source/macOS consumer integration.

Development smoke can override the headless executable:

```bash
LOCUS_HEADLESS_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/locus-electron-wrapper \
LOCUS_USER_DATA_DIR=/tmp/locus-api-profile \
resources/cli/locus api runtimes list --json
```

Production consumers should not set `LOCUS_HEADLESS_EXECUTABLE`. It exists for
local QA and packaging smoke.

## Command Reference

```bash
locus api runtimes list --json
locus api runs create --request <path|-> --json
locus api runs status <job-id> --json
locus api runs events <job-id> [--after <sequence>] [--follow] --jsonl
locus api runs result <job-id> --json
locus api runs cancel <job-id> --json
locus api runs retry <job-id> --json
locus api projects register --cwd <path> [--name <name>] --json
locus api projects status --cwd <path> --json
locus api projects unregister --cwd <path> [--force] --json
```

Rules:

- JSON commands write parseable JSON to stdout.
- Event streams write one JSON object per line.
- Diagnostics and validation errors go to stderr.
- `--request -` reads the create request from stdin.
- `--after <sequence>` returns events with `sequence` greater than that value.
- `create` and `retry` run synchronously and return after the run reaches a
  terminal status.
- `projects unregister` is non-destructive: it removes the project from active
  registration but does not delete chats, sub-chats, worktrees, job history, or
  repository files. Permanent project-history deletion is desktop UI only.

## Minimal Consumer Flow

1. Build or locate a downstream package directory.
2. Ensure `project.cwd` points to a Locus-registered local project or a
   subdirectory inside one.
3. Put `artifacts.baseDir` inside `project.cwd`.
4. List runtime capabilities.
5. Create a run with `locus api runs create`.
6. Read `status`, `events`, and `result` by job ID.
7. Let the downstream app promote or copy final business artifacts only after
   its own user review.

## Project Registration Commands

Consumers can register a project path before creating runs:

```bash
locus api projects register --cwd "$PROJECT_DIR" --json
locus api projects status --cwd "$PROJECT_DIR" --json
locus api projects unregister --cwd "$PROJECT_DIR" --json
```

Registration is idempotent by canonical project path. In the project lifecycle
change, re-registering a removed project restores the existing project
registration and keeps retained chat history linked to the same project.

`unregister` means "remove from the active Projects list." It is a soft removal
for automation safety:

- it does not delete chats or sub-chats
- it does not delete Locus worktrees
- it does not delete job history
- it does not delete repository files
- `--force` only bypasses the active-job refusal for active-list removal; it
  still does not delete project history

There is no `locus api projects delete-history` command in v1. Permanent project
history deletion is available only in the desktop UI, after the project has first
been removed from the active Projects list and the user confirms the affected
chat/worktree counts.

## Runtime Capabilities

Check runtime capabilities before creating a job:

```bash
locus api runtimes list --json
```

Response shape:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "locus.local-job.v1",
  "features": ["runtime-readiness", "provider-binding"],
  "runtimes": [
    {
      "runtimeId": "codex",
      "readiness": {
        "state": "needs-auth",
        "detail": "Codex login is required.",
        "hint": "Connect Codex with ChatGPT login, use a Codex API key, or choose a provider profile."
      },
      "capabilities": [
        {
          "id": "planMode",
          "state": "supported",
          "scope": "runtime",
          "reason": "..."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

`readiness.state` is advisory and can be `ready`, `needs-auth`, `unavailable`,
or `unknown`. Discovery still exits 0 and returns the full manifest list when a
readiness probe fails; that runtime reports `unknown` and diagnostics go to
stderr. Use `locus api runtimes list --json --no-probe` to skip subprocess
status probes; skipped probed states report `unknown` rather than `ready`.

Use `runtime.requiredCapabilities` in the create request when the downstream
workflow depends on a capability. Locus rejects unsupported or degraded required
capabilities before provider work starts.

Common runtime IDs:

- `codex`
- `claude-code`
- `claude` as an accepted alias for `claude-code`

Common modes:

- `plan`
- `agent`

Execution profiles:

- omit `runtime.executionProfile` or set `batch`: default v1 behavior. Codex
  uses `codex exec`; Claude uses `claude -p` when capability and permission
  gates allow the run.
- `policy-grant`: advanced, explicit opt-in for a non-batch adapter profile.
  It currently requires `runtime.policyGrant.scopes` and is treated as
  admission/audit metadata in v1. The declared scope strings are not yet a
  stable per-scope app-server enforcement boundary.

Provider selection:

- omit `provider`: Locus first checks the headless default profile for the
  runtime (`claude-main` for Claude Code, `codex-main` for Codex). If no
  default profile is configured, the runtime uses its native credentials.
- set `provider.profileId`: Locus resolves that stored provider profile in the
  main process, creates a scoped local gateway token for this run, and fails
  closed if the profile is missing, targets another runtime, or cannot decrypt.
- set `provider.model`: passes a model override. When used without
  `provider.profileId`, it selects runtime-managed credentials and bypasses
  headless defaults.

Consumers must pass only provider references. Never send provider tokens,
headers, or environment variables in `provider`, `input`, or artifacts.

## Create Request

Example for a generic local package:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "locus.local-job.v1",
  "consumer": {
    "id": "docs-workbench",
    "runExternalId": "package-review-001"
  },
  "project": {
    "cwd": "/Users/alice/LocalPackages/example-package",
    "projectId": null
  },
  "runtime": {
    "id": "codex",
    "requiredCapabilities": ["planMode"]
  },
  "mode": "plan",
  "prompt": {
    "text": "Review this local package and produce a readiness note."
  },
  "provider": {
    "profileId": "codex-main",
    "model": "gpt-5.3-codex"
  },
  "input": {
    "contract": "example.local-package.v1",
    "packageDir": "/Users/alice/LocalPackages/example-package",
    "sourceMetadata": "source.json"
  },
  "artifacts": {
    "baseDir": "/Users/alice/LocalPackages/example-package/.locus/runs",
    "writePolicy": "metadata-only"
  }
}
```

Run it:

```bash
locus api runs create --request request.json --json
```

Or pipe it:

```bash
cat request.json | locus api runs create --request - --json
```

## Request Fields

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apiVersion` | yes | Must be `locus.local-job.v1`. |
| `consumer.id` | yes | Stable downstream app ID, such as `docs-workbench`. |
| `consumer.runExternalId` | no | Consumer-owned run ID for correlation. |
| `project.cwd` | yes | Absolute local path for the run. Must exist and be inside a registered Locus project. |
| `project.projectId` | no | Optional Locus project ID. If provided, `cwd` must be inside that project. |
| `runtime.id` | yes | `codex`, `claude-code`, or accepted alias `claude`. |
| `runtime.requiredCapabilities` | no | Capability IDs that must be supported before runtime work starts. |
| `runtime.executionProfile` | no | `batch` or `policy-grant`. Defaults to `batch`; existing v1 callers should omit it unless they need the explicit gated profile. |
| `runtime.policyGrant.scopes` | when `runtime.executionProfile` is `policy-grant` | Bounded scope labels for admission/audit. In v1 these labels do not yet bind app-server permission decisions. |
| `runtime.policyGrant.canDecideAutomatically` | no | Optional boolean. If false for `policy-grant`, Locus fails closed because no visible user is available. |
| `mode` | yes | `plan` or `agent`. |
| `prompt.text` | yes | Prompt text. Max size is 256 KiB. |
| `provider.profileId` | no | Stored provider profile ID. The request carries only the reference; Locus resolves credentials in the main process. |
| `provider.model` | no | Model override. Without `provider.profileId`, this uses runtime-managed credentials and does not consult defaults. |
| `input` | no | Consumer-owned structured metadata. Must not contain secrets. |
| `artifacts.baseDir` | no | Absolute directory for Locus run metadata. Must be inside `project.cwd`. |
| `artifacts.writePolicy` | no | `metadata-only` or `proposal-only`. Defaults to `metadata-only`. |

Identifier limits:

- `consumer.id`: 1-80 chars, letters, numbers, `.`, `_`, `:`, `-`
- `consumer.runExternalId`: 1-160 chars, same character set
- request JSON: max 1 MiB

## Artifact Contract

If `artifacts.baseDir` is set, Locus writes run-owned metadata here:

```text
<artifacts.baseDir>/<jobId>/
  request.json
  events.jsonl
  result.json
  artifacts.json
```

For a generic local package, the recommended layout is:

```text
example-package/
  source.json
  source.md
  notes.md
  drafts/
  final/
  .locus/
    runs/
      <jobId>/
        request.json
        events.jsonl
        result.json
        artifacts.json
```

Rules:

- `artifacts.baseDir` must be absolute.
- It must be inside `project.cwd`.
- It cannot be inside `.git`.
- It cannot be inside a path component named `final`.
- If it already exists, it must be a directory.
- Existing path components cannot be symlinks that escape the project.
- Locus does not promote output into downstream `final/` directories in v1.

Use `final/` only for downstream/user-approved material.

## Create Response

`create` returns a v1 envelope with the serialized job and final result:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "locus.local-job.v1",
  "job": {
    "id": "mpzcxv3xp2ji1fl2",
    "source": "api",
    "runtime": "codex",
    "mode": "plan",
    "status": "succeeded",
    "apiConsumerId": "docs-workbench",
    "apiConsumerRunId": "package-review-001",
    "artifactManifestPath": "/.../.locus/runs/mpzcxv3xp2ji1fl2/artifacts.json"
  },
  "result": {
    "apiVersion": "locus.local-job.v1",
    "jobId": "mpzcxv3xp2ji1fl2",
    "status": "succeeded",
    "runtime": "codex",
    "mode": "plan",
    "consumer": {
      "id": "docs-workbench",
      "runExternalId": "package-review-001"
    },
    "artifactManifestPath": "/.../.locus/runs/mpzcxv3xp2ji1fl2/artifacts.json",
    "providerProfileId": "codex-main",
    "modelOverride": "gpt-5.3-codex",
    "artifacts": [],
    "diagnostics": [],
    "resolvedProvider": {
      "source": "request-profile",
      "profileId": "codex-main",
      "model": "gpt-5.3-codex"
    },
    "result": {}
  }
}
```

The exact `job` object may include additional renderer-safe fields. Consumers
should require only fields documented in this guide.

## Status

```bash
locus api runs status <job-id> --json
```

Response:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "locus.local-job.v1",
  "job": {
    "id": "mpzcxv3xp2ji1fl2",
    "source": "api",
    "status": "succeeded"
  }
}
```

Only `source=api` jobs can be read through `locus api runs ...`.

## Events

```bash
locus api runs events <job-id> --after 0 --jsonl
```

Each line is one event envelope:

```json
{"apiVersion":"locus.local-job.v1","jobId":"mpzcxv3xp2ji1fl2","sequence":1,"type":"job_created","createdAt":"2026-06-04T10:33:00.000Z","payload":{}}
```

Stable v1 event types:

- `job_created`
- `job_started`
- `assistant_delta`
- `reasoning_delta`
- `tool_started`
- `tool_delta`
- `tool_finished`
- `artifact_created`
- `status`
- `error`
- `completed`

Resume logic:

```text
lastSequence = 0
read events with --after lastSequence
for each event:
  process event
  lastSequence = event.sequence
repeat until job is terminal
```

Use `--follow` if you want the command to wait for new events until the job is
terminal.

## Result

```bash
locus api runs result <job-id> --json
```

Response:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "locus.local-job.v1",
  "jobId": "mpzcxv3xp2ji1fl2",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "runtime": "codex",
  "mode": "plan",
  "consumer": {
    "id": "docs-workbench",
    "runExternalId": "package-review-001"
  },
  "artifactManifestPath": "/.../.locus/runs/mpzcxv3xp2ji1fl2/artifacts.json",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "role": "request",
      "path": "/.../request.json",
      "sha256": "...",
      "contentType": "application/json",
      "sizeBytes": 1234
    }
  ],
  "diagnostics": [],
  "resolvedProvider": {
    "source": "request-profile",
    "profileId": "codex-main",
    "model": "gpt-5.3-codex"
  },
  "result": {
    "finalMessage": "..."
  }
}
```

Read `diagnostics` before treating a non-success status as user-visible output.
`resolvedProvider` is authoritative only on terminal result envelopes. In-flight
status polling may show provisional provider fields while Locus is still
resolving defaults or minting scoped gateway tokens.

Provider binding errors are fail-closed. If an explicitly selected profile or a
configured headless default profile is unavailable, the job fails with a
structured diagnostic such as `provider_profile_not_found`,
`provider_profile_runtime_mismatch`, or `provider_profile_unavailable`. Locus
does not silently fall back to native runtime credentials in those cases.
`provider_profile_not_found` and `provider_profile_runtime_mismatch` are invalid
request errors and exit `2`; `provider_profile_unavailable` is a credential
availability error and exits `4`.

## Cancel

```bash
locus api runs cancel <job-id> --json
```

Cancel is scoped to API jobs. A queued API job is completed as `canceled`
immediately. A running job receives a persisted cancel request that the runtime
runner observes.

## Retry

```bash
locus api runs retry <job-id> --json
```

Retry is allowed only for API jobs in terminal retryable states:

- `failed`
- `canceled`
- `interrupted`

`retry` creates a new API job, links it with `retryOfJobId`, prepares a new
artifact run directory, runs synchronously, and returns the same envelope shape
as `create`.

Do not use `locus jobs retry` for API jobs. That command is reserved for
non-API human-oriented job flows.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Success. |
| `1` | Runtime failed. |
| `2` | Invalid arguments or invalid request/artifact contract. |
| `3` | Unsupported runtime, mode, or required capability. |
| `4` | Missing runtime credentials. |
| `5` | Job canceled. |
| `6` | Local-only guard blocked the run. |
| `7` | Invalid or unregistered `project.cwd`. |
| `8` | Internal failure. |

Consumers should parse stdout only when the exit code and command contract
allow it. Diagnostics are on stderr.

## Security Rules

Do not put these in the request:

- provider API keys
- OAuth tokens
- `Authorization` headers
- raw environment variables
- passwords
- private keys
- credential file contents

Locus resolves runtime credentials through its own main-process provider and
runtime setup paths. The consumer sends domain context, not provider secrets.
For provider-backed runs, send `provider.profileId` and optionally
`provider.model`; Locus owns the scoped gateway token lifecycle.

Secret-like keys or values are rejected before provider work starts.

## Integration Example

Recommended downstream app flow:

```text
1. User creates or reviews a local work package.
2. The downstream app creates a local package:

   packages/<example-package>/
     source.json
     source.md
     notes.md
     drafts/
     final/

3. The downstream app writes request.json with:
   project.cwd = packages/<example-package>
   input.packageDir = packages/<example-package>
   artifacts.baseDir = packages/<example-package>/.locus/runs

4. The downstream app runs:
   locus api runs create --request request.json --json

5. The downstream app reads result/artifacts/events.
6. The downstream app shows the user proposed output.
7. The downstream app writes or promotes final artifacts only after user approval.
```

Minimal shell example:

```bash
PACKAGE_DIR="$HOME/LocalPackages/example-package"
mkdir -p "$PACKAGE_DIR/.locus/runs" "$PACKAGE_DIR/drafts" "$PACKAGE_DIR/final"

cat > "$PACKAGE_DIR/request.json" <<EOF
{
  "apiVersion": "locus.local-job.v1",
  "consumer": {
    "id": "docs-workbench",
    "runExternalId": "example-package-001"
  },
  "project": {
    "cwd": "$PACKAGE_DIR"
  },
  "runtime": {
    "id": "codex",
    "requiredCapabilities": ["planMode"]
  },
  "mode": "plan",
  "prompt": {
    "text": "Review this local package and identify missing source material."
  },
  "input": {
    "contract": "example.local-package.v1",
    "packageDir": "$PACKAGE_DIR"
  },
  "artifacts": {
    "baseDir": "$PACKAGE_DIR/.locus/runs",
    "writePolicy": "metadata-only"
  }
}
EOF

locus api runs create --request "$PACKAGE_DIR/request.json" --json
```

`PACKAGE_DIR` must be inside a project already registered with Locus.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `project.cwd must be inside a registered project` | The package directory is not registered or not under a registered Locus project. | Open/register the project in Locus, or pass a cwd inside a registered project. |
| `artifacts.baseDir must be inside project.cwd` | Artifact base is outside the run cwd. | Use `<project.cwd>/.locus/runs`. |
| `artifacts.baseDir cannot be inside a final artifact directory` | Locus refuses to write metadata into downstream final material. | Move API metadata to `.locus/runs`. |
| `Unsupported runtime.id` | Runtime ID is not recognized. | Use `codex`, `claude-code`, or `claude`. |
| `Unsupported required capability` | Capability ID is unknown. | Inspect `locus api runtimes list --json`. |
| Exit `4` | Runtime credentials are missing. | Configure the runtime in Locus. Do not send credentials in the request. |
| JSON parse fails | The command may have failed and wrote diagnostics to stderr. | Check exit code and stderr before parsing stdout. |

## Stability Contract

Stable in v1:

- command names under `locus api`
- `apiVersion: locus.local-job.v1`
- documented request fields
- documented response envelopes
- documented event envelope fields
- run metadata artifact file names
- secret rejection boundary
- non-destructive `projects unregister` semantics

Not stable in v1:

- extra fields inside serialized `job`
- internal SQLite schema
- internal event payload details beyond the v1 envelope
- Workbench rendering details
- human CLI formatting under `locus run` and `locus jobs`

Use the documented v1 fields and ignore unknown JSON fields.
