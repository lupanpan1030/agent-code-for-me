# canonical-entity-vocabulary Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change refactor-canonical-vocabulary. Update Purpose after archive.

## Requirements

### Requirement: UI refers to each entity by its single canonical term

User-facing copy MUST refer to each Locus entity by exactly one canonical term —
Project, Workspace, Chat, Quick chat, Agent, Run — and MUST NOT label those
entities with retired synonyms ("sub-chat"/"subchat"/"子对话" for the Chat
entity, or "agent"/"chat" for the Workspace layer). The terms are defined in
`docs/ideas/canonical-vocabulary.md`.

#### Scenario: A retired Chat synonym does not appear in i18n values

- **WHEN** the architecture guard checks the English and Simplified Chinese
  dictionaries
- **THEN** it parses dictionary entries structurally rather than by
  formatting-sensitive regular-expression slicing
- **AND** it fails if any dictionary value contains a retired Chat synonym
  ("sub-chat" / "Sub-chat" / "subchat" / "子对话")
- **AND** any intentional exception requires an explicit allowlist entry in the
  guard with a reason

#### Scenario: The worktree layer is called Workspace, not chat/agent

- **WHEN** the user sees a label for the isolation unit (a `chats`-table row:
  worktree + branch)
- **THEN** it reads "Workspace" (or "Quick chat" when project-less), never "agent"
  or a bare "chat"

### Requirement: Create actions follow the canonical entry grammar

Each create action MUST be labeled for the entity it creates, per the §4 grammar
(New Project / New Workspace / New Chat / New Quick chat / New Agent), and the word
"Agent" MUST NOT appear on a workspace- or chat-create control.

#### Scenario: Label matches the created entity

- **WHEN** a create action runs (e.g. the sidebar action that starts a project-less
  chat via `setNewChatTarget({ type: "quick" })`)
- **THEN** its label is the canonical term for what it creates ("New Quick chat"),
  and any handler whose name asserts a different entity is renamed to match

#### Scenario: Key and value agree

- **WHEN** an i18n key names an action (e.g. `settings.keyboard.actions.newWorkspace`)
- **THEN** its value uses the matching canonical term ("New Workspace"), not a
  mismatched synonym ("New chat")

### Requirement: Entry and empty-state language is unified

Empty-state and onboarding entry copy MUST use one phrasing per concept, with one
verb per concept (Open a Project, Start a Quick chat, Connect a provider, Attach a
Project), replacing the multiple current phrasings.

#### Scenario: The "no project" moment uses one phrasing

- **WHEN** the app shows a no-project / get-started state
- **THEN** it uses the unified entry grammar ("Open a Project" primary, "Start a
  Quick chat" secondary), not one of several ad-hoc phrasings

### Requirement: The rename does not touch the code/data layer

This change MUST be confined to user-facing strings plus a named set of misleading
handlers; it MUST NOT rename DB tables, schema-aligned code identifiers, or the
job API contract.

#### Scenario: Data and API contracts are unchanged

- **WHEN** the vocabulary change is applied
- **THEN** the `projects`/`chats`/`sub_chats`/`agent_jobs` tables, the `subChatId`/
  `SubChat` code identifiers, and the `job` / `local-job-api` v1 contract are
  unchanged, and "Run" appears only in UI copy

#### Scenario: i18n keys are stable, values change

- **WHEN** a mislabeled i18n entry is corrected
- **THEN** the key identifier is preserved and only its value changes (unless a key
  rename is trivially safe)

### Requirement: Engine vocabulary has a single code-level identity source

Per the ratified D7 addendum (`docs/ideas/canonical-vocabulary.md` §8, 2026-08-25), a selectable
Claude Code/Codex runtime MUST be called "Engine" in UI copy and UI-layer selection code, its
API and persistence identity MUST remain `runtimeId`-shaped, and "Agent" MUST NOT name an
engine-selection surface. Engine id unions in code MUST derive from `CONTRACT_RUNTIME_IDS` in
`src/shared/agent-runtime-capabilities.ts` as the single source; a second independent engine-id
enum MUST NOT exist.

#### Scenario: Engine picker lists only live engines under Engine vocabulary

- **WHEN** the new-chat engine selection renders
- **THEN** it offers exactly the contract engines (Claude Code and Codex)
- **AND** no retired engine entry (such as a disabled Cursor CLI row) is listed
- **AND** the selection code names the concept Engine, not Agent

#### Scenario: Architecture guard rejects a second engine-id enum

- **WHEN** the architecture guard check runs
- **THEN** it fails if the shared chat vocabulary module declares an engine-id array literal
  independent of `CONTRACT_RUNTIME_IDS`
- **AND** the failure message names the canonical owner

#### Scenario: Persisted engine metadata key is stable

- **WHEN** chat message metadata is written or read
- **THEN** the persisted JSON key remains `provider` with unchanged runtime-id values
- **AND** engine inference from historical messages keeps working without migration
