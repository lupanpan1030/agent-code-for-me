Locus is moving from a coding-only desktop app toward a local-first AI
workbench for operating on local projects with mature agent CLI workflows and
selectable model backends. It is a user-facing workspace first. Runtime
adapters, local jobs, daemon, schedules, and protocol surfaces are supporting
infrastructure underneath the workbench.

## Positioning

Locus should own the local workbench experience and the runtime layer behind it:

- local project, worktree, file, terminal, and git workspace surfaces
- agent interaction flows for Claude Code, Codex, custom providers, MCP, and skills
- visible file edits, shell commands, git operations, tool use, approvals, and cancellation
- runtime setup and capability truth for each supported agent runtime
- local execution history, event logs, retry, recovery, and auditability
- headless CLI, daemon, schedules, and protocol entry points for automation and integrations
- safety boundaries for provider credentials, MCP, filesystem access, and future computer-control tools

Coding is still the first strong workflow, but it is not the only long-term
workflow. Other local-first tools can integrate with Locus, but the core product
is still the desktop workbench where users operate on local projects directly.

This document describes implemented workbench and Local Job API surfaces. It is
not the current roadmap and does not authorize broader workflow engines, new
Engine integrations, or full ACP parity.

## Current Usable Surfaces

These surfaces exist today and are the safest integration points for nearby
projects:

| Surface | Use it for | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop Workbench | Inspect and control local jobs from the UI | Implemented |
| `locus run` | One-shot local tasks | Implemented; macOS smoked |
| `locus jobs` | List, show, logs, cancel, retry | Implemented; macOS smoked |
| `locus run --daemon` | Submit queued background work | Implemented; macOS smoked |
| `locus daemon run` | Claim daemon and schedule jobs | Implemented; macOS smoked |
| `locus schedules` | Create, pause, resume, delete, and run local schedules | Implemented; macOS smoked |
| `locus api` | Machine-readable Local Job API v1 for downstream consumers | Implemented; macOS smoked |
| `locus acp` | Minimal stdio protocol for job-backed runs | Experimental |

Windows source and shim behavior are covered by tests. Packaged Windows
real-machine smoke is explicitly deferred and non-blocking for current local
platform work, Local Job API v1, and downstream integration. Do not describe the
Windows packaged build as accepted until that evidence exists.

## Safety and Privacy Boundaries

Local-first means Locus stores jobs, event logs, settings, and project state
locally by default. It does not mean offline-only. Prompts, selected file
content, diffs, audio, tool context, or metadata may still be sent to the
user-selected runtime, provider, MCP server, or GitHub workflow.

Locus is not an OS sandbox. Terminal, git, filesystem, MCP, runtime tools, and
future computer-control flows can affect the local machine when authorized or
invoked. Describe supported safeguards as project/worktree-aware controls, not
as complete filesystem isolation.

Provider credentials should be resolved in the main process and renderer APIs
should receive only IDs, status, and redacted metadata. Job payloads, event
logs, ACP requests, and downstream integration payloads must not carry provider
secrets. Voice transcription now uses the Helper API provider configuration
path; do not reintroduce a renderer/env API-key fallback. New credential writes
use main-process secure storage, while legacy base64 reads remain compatibility
only and should not be described as retroactive encryption of historical data.

## Recommended Integration Model

Downstream projects should call Locus at the work or job boundary instead of
embedding Claude Code or Codex CLIs directly.

![Downstream projects use the Locus job boundary](assets/locus-downstream-integrations.svg)

Recommended shape:

```text
Downstream app
  -> Locus workbench, CLI, or future local protocol/API
  -> Locus runtime and local execution history
  -> AgentRuntime adapter
  -> Claude Code / Codex / provider runtime
```

The downstream app should own its domain state and final user-facing workflow.
Locus should own execution, logs, runtime capability checks, cancellation,
background queueing, and local auditability.

## Example Downstream Projects

These are intended integration patterns, not claims that all integrations are
already implemented.

### Document Review Workbench

A document review app can keep source files, notes, drafts, and approved
artifacts in its own local workspace while using Locus to run review and draft
jobs.

Good first integration:

```text
source files / local package
  -> create Locus job
  -> stream job events
  -> write reviewed draft only after user confirmation
```

### Calendar and Planning Assistant

A calendar/planning tool can use daemon-backed schedules for recurring review
or planning jobs, but should default to plan/review mode and require explicit
approval before mutating calendar data.

Good first integration:

```text
local schedule
  -> queued Locus job
  -> plan or review output
  -> explicit user approval
  -> downstream app writes calendar changes
```

### Computer Operation Workbench

A computer-operation project can use Locus as the runtime/job layer, but it
must treat screen control, filesystem mutation, shell commands, and credentials
as separate high-risk capability gates.

Good first integration:

```text
external control app
  -> Locus job with declared capability needs
  -> explicit user-visible permission gates
  -> event log and cancel path stay in Locus
```

## What Locus Should Not Claim Yet

Do not claim these as implemented:

- full ACP compatibility
- hosted cloud agents
- hosted or OS-level scheduling
- full Claude Code and Codex behavior parity
- generic safe retry for desktop chat jobs
- automatic computer control without explicit permission gates
- a security sandbox for arbitrary plugin or runtime code
- Windows packaged acceptance claims before Windows real-machine smoke
- offline-only or fully private execution
- complete filesystem isolation
- all historical credential data retroactively migrated to encrypted storage

## Protocol Strategy

The current `locus acp` surface is intentionally small. It proves that external
stdio requests can create local jobs, stream job events, cancel jobs, and shut
down without corrupting structured stdout.

It is not a full ACP server yet. Full ACP parity should be a separate project
with explicit protocol, session, permission, MCP, reconnect, and compatibility
tests.

The recommended downstream platform boundary is now the Locus-owned Local Job
API v1. ACP can then become one adapter over that stable local API rather than
the only platform interface.

## Local Job API v1

Local Job API v1 is implemented as the `locus api` CLI group. Downstream
projects should read the consumer guide rather than the OpenSpec proposal:

- [Local Job API v1 Consumer Guide](local-job-api-v1-consumer-guide.md)
- [Local Job API v1 Consumer Guide, Simplified Chinese](local-job-api-v1-consumer-guide.zh-CN.md)

Minimum useful operations:

- create a job with runtime, mode, cwd, prompt, source, and optional project link
- read job status
- stream events after a sequence number
- cancel a job
- retry a retryable job
- list runtime capabilities
- reject unsupported capabilities before runtime work starts
- keep stdout/stdin protocol modes machine-readable
- keep provider secrets out of request payloads, event logs, and renderer data

## Roadmap

Recommended order:

1. Keep the Local Job API v1 consumer guide aligned with implementation and
   smoke evidence.
2. Let downstream projects integrate through the job boundary.
3. Add stronger capability and permission gates for non-coding domains.
4. Harden documentation and release wording so local macOS completion is not
   confused with cross-platform release readiness.
5. Add full ACP parity only when a real external client needs standard ACP
   session/protocol behavior.
6. Add hosted or OS-level scheduling only after the local daemon and job
   recovery model are stable on both macOS and Windows.
7. Run Windows packaged real-machine smoke as a deferred platform/release
   acceptance task, not as a blocker for the current local platform roadmap.

## Documentation Rule

Public wording should describe implemented evidence, not aspiration.

Use:

```text
local-first AI workbench
selectable model backends
runtime capability truth
provider compatibility and diagnostics
MCP state, tool activity, file changes, usage, and run history
Local Job API as supporting automation infrastructure
minimal ACP stdio job surface
macOS local smoke complete; Windows packaged real-machine smoke deferred
```

Avoid:

```text
complete ACP server
universal automation platform
AI OS
local job platform
runtime hub
workflow orchestrator
fully cross-platform accepted
secure sandbox for arbitrary extensions
offline-only
fully private
all historical credentials retroactively encrypted
complete filesystem isolation
Claude and Codex parity
cloud agent platform
```
